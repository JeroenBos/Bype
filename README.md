# Bype

### This is going to be the best Android keyboard ever
(although it sucks now). 


It's a personal ML project, where I want to ML to intepret the swipe trails on the keyboard. 
If that works, then down the line I would like to incorporate it with a contextual NLP predictor. 
If that doesn't get the error rate under 0.1%, then nothing will.

P.S. it's called Bype because it's similar to Swype but that name was already taken
